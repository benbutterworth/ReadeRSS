# ReadeRSS
> A quick script to filter content from various RSS feeds by keyword.

This brief Python program is a minimally functional, coarse grained RSS feed reader and filter. It is neither a comprehensive tool for aggregating content nor a refined search tool. But chuck in a bunch of RSS feeds and keywords and it will find you the content you want to see.

## Usage
1. Create your own collection of RSS feeds in a `.csv` file with the second collumn containing the URL link.
2. List one keyword or phrase per line in a `keywords.txt` file.
3. Run `ReadeRSS.py` and tell it where to find these files.
