# Ben's RSS Reader
> A utility program for filtering content from RSS feeds from various scientific publications.

This brief Python program is a minimally functional, coarse grained RSS feed reader and filter. It is neither a comprehensive tool for aggregating content nor a refined search and filter. But chuck in a bunch of RSS feeds and keywords and it will find you the content you want to see.
